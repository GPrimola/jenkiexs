### WELCOME HACKTOBERFEST PARTYPEOPLE!! 🎉🎊🥳👩🏿‍💻👩🏾‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩🏼‍💻👩🏻‍💻👩‍💻👨‍💻👨🏻‍💻👨🏼‍💻👨🏽‍💻👨🏾‍💻👨🏿‍💻

#### Here are some few things I'd like to ask you beforehand for this event!

##### Basic Code of Conduct

1. Be nice to other people, no matter what, should you interact with anyone.
2. Open **short**, but **meaningful** and **valuable**, **PR**(s). This way is easier to review on time.
    - E.g.: Instead of document a whole module, you can document just one function, for instance. This goes with the Quality over Quantity value from Hacktoberfest.
3. This is a fresh repository which I'm already using in production. I apologize for the lack of more information but feel free to interact with me through the Issues or [twitter](https://twitter.com/lu_gico) with the hashtag #elixirJenkiexs.

#### We appreciate your collaboration! Thank you very much!! 🙏🏿🙏🏾🙏🏽🙏🏼🙏🏻🙏✨
